Tutorial on setting up a sample Facebook application with Rails 3
and RestGraph could be found on [samplergthree][]. Instead, if you're
an experienced Ruby programmer, you might also want to look at
[detailed documents][].

## DESCRIPTION:

A lightweight Facebook Graph API client

## FEATURES:

* Simple Graph API call
* Simple FQL call
* Utility to extract access_token and check sig in cookies/signed_request

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Tested with MRI 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 and Rubinius 1.2.2.
  Because of development gems can't work well on JRuby,
  let me know if rest-graph is working on JRuby, thanks!

* (must) pick one HTTP client:
  - gem install rest-client
  - gem install em-http-request

* (optional) pick one JSON parser/generator:
  - gem install yajl-ruby
  - gem install json
  - gem install json_pure

* (optional) parse access_token in HTTP_COOKIE
  - gem install rack

* (optional) to use rest-graph/test_util
  - gem install rr

## INSTALLATION:

    gem install rest-graph

Or if you want development version, put this in Gemfile:

    gem 'rest-graph', :git => 'git://github.com/cardinalblue/rest-graph.git

Or as a Rails2 plugin:

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/cardinalblue/rest-graph.git

## QUICK START:

    require 'rest-graph'
    rg = RestGraph.new(:access_token => 'myaccesstokenfromfb')
    rg.get('me')
    rg.get('me/likes')
    rg.get('search', :q => 'taiwan')

### Obtaining an access token

If you are using Rails, we recommend that you include a module called
RestGraph::RailsUtil into your controllers. (Your code contributions
for other Ruby frameworks would be appreciated!). RestGraph::RailsUtil
adds the following two methods to your controllers:

    rest_graph_setup:   Attempts to find an access_token from the environment
                        and initializes a RestGraph object with it.
                        Most commonly used inside a filter.

    rest_graph:         Accesses the RestGraph object by rest_graph_setup.

### Example usage:

    class MyController < ActionController::Base
      include RestGraph::RailsUtil
      before_filter :setup

      def myaction
        @medata = rest_graph.get('me')
      end

      private
      def setup
        rest_graph_setup(:app_id               => '123',
                         :canvas               => 'mycanvas',
                         :auto_authorize_scope => 'email')
                         # See below for more options
      end
    end

### Default setup

New RestGraph objects can read their default setup configuration from a
YAML configuration file. Which is the same as passing to rest_graph_setup.

* [Example](test/config/rest-graph.yaml)

To enable, just require anywhere:

    require 'rest-graph'

Or if you're using bundler, add this line into Gemfile:

    gem 'rest-graph'

## SETUP OPTIONS:

Here are ALL the available options for new instance of RestGraph.

    rg = RestGraph.new(
           :access_token  => TOKEN                        , # default nil
           :graph_server  => 'https://graph.facebook.com/', # this is default
           :old_server    => 'https://api.facebook.com/'  , # this is default
           :accept        => 'text/javascript'            , # this is default
           :lang          => 'en-us'                      , # affect search
           :auto_decode   =>  true                        , # decode by json
                                                            # default true
           :app_id        => '123'                        , # default nil
           :secret        => '1829'                       , # default nil

           :cache         => {}                           ,
           # A cache for the same API call. Any object quacks like a hash
           # should work, and Rails.cache works, too. (because of a patch in
           # RailsUtil)

           :error_handler => lambda{|hash| raise RestGraph::Error.new(hash)},
           # This handler callback is only called if auto_decode is
           # set to true, otherwise, it's ignored. And raising exception
           # is the default unless you're using RailsUtil and enabled
           # auto_authorize. That way, RailsUtil would do redirect
           # instead of raising an exception.

           :log_method    => method(:puts),
           # This way, any log message would be output by puts. If you want to
           # change the log format, use log_handler instead. See below:

           :log_handler   => lambda{ |event|
             Rails.logger.
               debug("Spent #{event.duration} requesting #{event.url}")})
           # You might not want to touch this if you're using RailsUtil.
           # Otherwise, the default behavior is do nothing. (i.e. no logging)

And here are ALL the available options for rest_graph_setup. Note that all
options for RestGraph instance are also valid options for rest_graph_setup.

    rest_graph_setup(#
                     # == All the above RestGraph options, plus
                     #
                     :canvas                 => 'mycanvas', # default ''
                     :auto_authorize         => true      , # default false
                     :auto_authorize_scope   => 'email'   , # default ''
                     :auto_authorize_options => {}        , # default {}
                     # auto_authorize means it will do redirect to oauth
                     # API automatically if the access_token is invalid or
                     # missing. So you would like to setup scope if you're
                     # using it. Note that: setting scope implies setting
                     # auto_authorize to true, even it's false.

                     :ensure_authorized      => false     , # default false
                     # This means if the access_token is not there,
                     # then do auto_authorize.

                     :write_session          => true      , # default false
                     :write_cookies          => false     , # default false
                     :write_handler          =>
                       lambda{ |fbs| @cache[uid] = fbs }  , # default nil
                     :check_handler          =>
                       lambda{       @cache[uid] })         # default nil
                     # If we're not using Facebook JavaScript SDK,
                     # then we'll need to find a way to store the fbs,
                     # which contains access_token and/or user id. In a
                     # standalone site or iframe canvas application, you might
                     # want to just use the Rails (or other framework) session

### Alternate ways to setup RestGraph:

1. Set upon RestGraph object creation:

    rg = RestGraph.new :app_id => 1234

2. Set via the rest_graph_setup call in a Controller:

    rest_graph_setup :app_id => 1234

3. Load from a YAML file

    require 'rest-graph/config_util'
    RestGraph.load_config('path/to/rest-graph.yaml', 'production')
    rg = RestGraph.new

4. Load config automatically

    require 'rest-graph'  # under Rails, would load config/rest-graph.yaml
    rg = RestGraph.new

5. Override directly

    module MyDefaults
      def default_app_id
        '456'
      end

      def default_secret
        'category theory'
      end
    end
    RestGraph.send(:extend, MyDefaults)
    rg = RestGraph.new

## API REFERENCE:

### Facebook Graph API:

#### get
    # GET https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=TOKEN
    rg.get('me')

    # GET https://graph.facebook.com/me?metadata=1&access_token=TOKEN
    rg.get('me', :metadata => '1')

    # extra options:
    #   auto_decode: Bool # decode with json or not in this method call
    #                     # default: auto_decode in rest-graph instance
    #        secret: Bool # use secret_acccess_token or not
    #                     # default: false
    #         cache: Bool # use cache or not; if it's false, update cache, too
    #                     # default: true
    #    expires_in: Int  # control when would the cache be expired
    #                     # default: nothing
    #         async: Bool # use eventmachine for http client or not
    #                     # default: false, but true in aget family
    rg.get('me', {:metadata => '1'}, :secret => true, expires_in => 600)

#### post

    rg.post('me/feed', :message => 'bread!')

#### fql

Make an arbitrary [FQL][] query

[FQL]: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/

    rg.fql('SELECT name FROM page WHERE page_id="123"')

#### fql_multi

    rg.fql_multi(:q1 => 'SELECT name FROM page WHERE page_id="123"',
                 :q2 => 'SELECT name FROM page WHERE page_id="456"')

#### old_rest

Call functionality from Facebook's old REST API:

    rg.old_rest(
      'stream.publish',
      { :message    => 'Greetings',
        :attachment => {:name => 'Wikipedia',
                        :href => 'http://wikipedia.org/',
                        :caption => 'Wikipedia says hi.',
                        :media => [{:type => 'image',
                                    :src  => 'http://wikipedia.org/logo.png',
                                    :href => 'http://wikipedia.org/'}]
                       }.to_json,
        :action_links => [{:text => 'Go to Wikipedia',
                           :href => 'http://wikipedia.org/'}
                         ].to_json
      },
      :auto_decode => false) # You'll need to set auto_decode to false for
                             # this API request if Facebook is not returning
                             # a proper formatted JSON response. Otherwise,
                             # this could be omitted.

    # Some Old Rest API requires a special access token with app secret
    # inside of it. For those methods, use secret_old_rest instead of the
    # usual old_rest with common access token.
    rg.secret_old_rest('admin.getAppProperties', :properties => 'app_id')

### Utility Methods:

#### parse_???

All the methods that obtain an access_token will automatically save it.

If you have the session in the cookies,
then RestGraph can parse the cookies:

    rg.parse_cookies!(cookies)

If you're writing a Rack application, you might want to parse
the session directly from Rack env:

    rg.parse_rack_env!(env)

#### access_token

    rg.access_token

Data associated with the access_token (which might or might not
available, depending on how the access_token was obtained).

    rg.data
    rg.data['uid']
    rg.data['expires']

#### Default values

Read from the rest-graph.yaml file.

    RestGraph.default_???

### Other ways of getting an access token

#### authorize_url

Returns the redirect URL for authorizing

    # https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?
    #   client_id=123&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fw3.org%2F
    rg.authorize_url(:redirect_uri => 'http://w3.org/', :scope => 'email')

#### authorize!

Makes a call to Facebook to convert
the authorization "code" into an access token:

    # https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?
    #   code=CODE&client_id=123&client_secret=1829&
    #   redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fw3.org%2F
    rg.authorize!(:redirect_uri => 'http://w3.org/', :code => 'CODE')

#### exchange_sessions

Takes a session key from the old REST API
(non-Graph API) and converts to an access token:

    # https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/exchange_sessions?sessions=SESSION
    rg.exchange_sessions(:sessions => params[:fb_sig_session_key])
